            <img src="IMG/spicelatte large.png" alt="A pumpkin spice latte is a coffee drink made with a mix of traditional fall spice flavors (cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove), steamed milk, espresso, and often sugar, topped with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spices. Starbucks began selling pumpkin spice lattes in late 2003.[1] It obtained a trademark for the abbreviation PSL in 2015.[2] The flavor has inspired a range of seasonal product variations.[3] The pumpkin spice latte has since been offered by chains including Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's.[4]">
