<h1>What is Iced Latte?</h1>

<h3>Let's Explain It Here:</h3>


<p>Iced coffee is made from coffee we brew earlier in the day that goes in a giant urn. We put in syrup and cream only.</p>

<p>Iced lattes are made with the McCafe machine which automatically grinds espresso beans fresh for the drinks every time. It has milk and syrup in it, but no cream.</p>

<p>Lattes aren't more difficult to make. The majority of the process is automated and all we have to do is add the ice and syrup to the cup and stir. It takes a bit longer because the machine is slow but that's it. There's no reason for you to be given iced coffee instead unless whoever is making it has no idea what they're doing.</p>
